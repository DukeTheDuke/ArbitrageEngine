# ArbitrageEngine

This project contains a simple prototype of an arbitrage detection engine. It is not intended for production use, but demonstrates how such an engine might be organized in Python.

## Running Tests

Tests are written with [pytest](https://pytest.org). From the project root, install dependencies (if needed) and run:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```

Running `pytest` will execute all tests under the `tests/` directory.
